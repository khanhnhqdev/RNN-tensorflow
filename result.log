Instructions for updating:
If using Keras pass *_constraint arguments to layers.

Instructions for updating:
This class is equivalent as tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell, and will be replaced by that in Tensorflow 2.0.

Instructions for updating:
Please use `keras.layers.RNN(cell, unroll=True)`, which is equivalent to this API

Instructions for updating:

Future major versions of TensorFlow will allow gradients to flow
into the labels input on backprop by default.
